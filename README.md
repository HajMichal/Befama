## Introduction 🚀
Hello there, welcome to the README file for my first commercial project. This endeavor focuses on creating a visually appealing and dynamic website for a textile factory. Notable challenges overcome include implementing language translations for Polish, English, German, and Russian, as well as addressing image quality issues. Additionally, the website boasts full responsiveness across various devices, from mobile phones and tablets to larger screens.

## Project Challanges 📋
### 1. Language Translations 🌐
###### One of the primary challenges tackled in this project was seamlessly implementing translations for four languages: Polish, English, German, and Russian. The website utilizes the powerful i18next library to provide a user-friendly experience for a diverse audience.

### 2. Image Quality Enhancement 🖼️
###### Addressing poor image quality was a crucial aspect of this project. I received old, bad light images and I had to pick the best ones and use them. Efforts were made to enhance image resolution and clarity, ensuring a visually appealing and professional appearance.

### 3. Responsive Design 📱💻
###### The website is built with a responsive design, adapting gracefully to different screen sizes. Whether viewed on a mobile phone, tablet, or a larger desktop screen, users can expect a consistent and optimized experience.

## What I've learned ?🎓

- SEO Basics 🕵️‍♂️: Basic search engine optimization (SEO) techniques were applied to improve the website's visibility and search engine rankings.

- i18next 🌐: This library was used to handle language translations efficiently, allowing users to switch seamlessly between Polish, English, German, and Russian.

- React and Next.js ⚛️: The project is built on the React framework with Next.js, providing a solid foundation for creating dynamic and high-performance web applications.

- Framer Motion 🚀: Framer Motion was utilized for adding smooth animations and transitions, enhancing the overall user experience.

- TypeScript 🧰: Basic knowledge of TypeScript was applied to ensure a more robust and maintainable codebase.

- Work with Client 👑: It was my first time that I have to adjust to client expectations.

## Summary 🌟

This project represents a milestone in my coding journey as it marks my first commercial project. During the development process, I encountered and overcame various challenges, learning valuable lessons along the way. 🙌
